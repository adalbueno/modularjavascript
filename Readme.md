# MODULAR JAVASCRIPT STUDIES

## Source Code
The source code can be found at the "src" folder.
For Javascript, I'm using Module Design Pattern to load the JSON data and DOM interations.
For CSS, I'm using Sass.
To compile CSS and concat JS files, I'm using the task runner Grunt.
If you want to run the project, you can just run the "grunt server" task and access it using the following URL: http://localhost:3000.

## Compiled Code
The compiled code ca be found at the "deploy" folder.
You cannot simply run the "index.html" file in the browser because I'm loading a JSON file using Ajax. You need a webserver. I recommend to use Grunt :)
