# TECHNICAL TEST FRONTEND DEVELOPER

## Background
Imagine a web site with a design based on the attached PSD or PNG files, where the user can see a list of articles. On the page there is a search function that filters articles. A user also has the possibility to mark articles as “favorite” which makes them appear in the "Your favorites" section. It is possible for a user to add articles by using a basic form.

## Tasks
  * Implement the page layout following the design in the attached files. The graphical interface should be responsive.
  * Show the search results according to the following criteria:
    * A search for “apple” will return the 5 articles with category “apple”.
    * A search for “lemon” will return the 2 articles with category “lemon”.
    * A search for “potato” will return 0 articles 
  
> Keep in mind that the search results will be delivered using Ajax, and with JSON as the exchange format between the backend and the frontend, so the page should not be reloaded to show them. Attached to the test you will find a file with the JSON structure and data that you should use.

  * Develop the functionality to allow the storage of the favorite articles. Once stored, they should appear in the “Your favorites” section.
  * Based on the style in the layout, complete the functionality for the user articles creation. Once created they should appear in the “Created by you” section. 

## Considerations
  * The site should be rendered correctly in IE10 and up, and in the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome.
  * You can use any framework you want but it’s not mandatory, it will not give you more points in the evaluation, what counts is the way you write your code.
  * Document any assumptions you make during development, if not defined in the background section.
  * Return the result of your efforts in a ZIP compressed file.
